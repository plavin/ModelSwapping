# HOW TO USE:
# An example is at the bottom of this file, in __main__.
# Basically, you just need to create a DWARFMap object by giving it
# the executable with dwarf info relating to your trace (e.g. compile with -g).
# Then, you can pass a trace into the classify function and you will get a
# dictonary back. This dict has keys that are function names and values that
# is the number of instructions from the trace corresponding to each function.

# A range represents a range of 64 bit addresses. Each one will be named for a
# function. Each can optionally hold a reference, which is the offset of a DIE
# that contains the function name associated with this range. This allows us
# to fill in the name later, if we don't know it right away (as is the case
# with inlined functions)
