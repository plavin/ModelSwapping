# Install DynamoRIO

You need to get a version of Memtrace, we recommend using 8.0.0-1, as that is what we used for this project.

Then follow these instructions to run memtrace and get a trace that this version of sve-cachesim can read


You should also download our custom version of Meabo from [here](https://github.com/plavin/meabo).
