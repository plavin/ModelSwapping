You may notice that some files are missing from this directory. The siimulation data is rougly 15GB for this project, and as such is too large to put on Github. Please email plavin3@gatech.edu to get a copy, or re-run the simulation yourself to regenerate this data.

You can run the same simulations we did with the python script in the top directory, `CollectDataPMBS20.py`.
